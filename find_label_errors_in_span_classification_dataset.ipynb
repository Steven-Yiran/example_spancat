    "This tutorial shows how can you use cleanlab to find potential label errors in text datasets for span classification. In span-classification, our data contains sentences in which every token (aka word) is labeled with one or more span classes, and we train models to predict the tokens that belongs to each span classes in a new sentence. This tutorial focus on question answering task as an example of span-classification task. Here, we will use a subset of the SQuAD dataset that contains 100 examples of questions, answers, and contexts. Each token is labeled with one of the two classes:\n",

    "In span classification, every token is labeled with one or more of the K span classes. To find label issues, cleanlab requires predicted class probabilities from a trained classifier. These `pred_probs` contain the probability of being in the `ANS` span for each token. Here we use `pred_probs` obtained from a BERT Transformer fit via cross-validation. Since cleanlab required the tokenized version of the input sentence, we will also convert the question and context in the original dataset into tokens and their corresponding span class label. The notebook \"span categorizer training\" contains the code to produce `pred_probs`, `labels`, `tokens`, `questions` and save them in a `.npz` file. Here, we load these data via the `read_npz` function."
